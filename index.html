            <h3>More about me</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> A Young Adult. An international student and a mixed plate (an inside joke). Yet Most importantly, I am a Muslim. And being a Muslim, I want to show the beauty of my faith andremove any misconceptions as much as possible. One way we can do this is by giving our best, when it comes that we provide a service and by doing good to others. </li>

                <li> I have partial Pakistani culture inculcated in me. This is one of the cultures where Islam is a big and a huge part of it. Unlike other religions or cultures, being practical and purposeful is an essential component. I bring this sub-topic up so I can tell you about one of my favorite dishes “Biryani”. For those who know what I am talking about, Congrats! Speaking of which, I also like to see Dreams!</li>

                <li> One of the things I like is exploring different cultures and places. I really want to travel different places and meet different kinds of people. The world is filled with blessings and provisions and one of the blessings is the abundant diversity and guess what? Allah mentions this in the Holy Qur’an by saying “O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allāh is the most righteous1 of you. Indeed, Allāh is Knowing and Aware.” (49:13)</li>

                                <h2>CSS Sprites: What are they ?</h2>

                <div>
                    <p>Working effortly to make a website appealing is one of the challengers multiple Web Designers have to face. The right choice of fonts, styles, box elements and Of Course, Animations. Animations on a website, like the smooth hover off the cursor, or the swift transition of the button and even the loading screen of that slow loading website. </p>

                        <p>One of the ways to apply Animation on certain sections of a website is through the use of CSS Animation. According to SimpliLearn, CSS Animations are “a way to create a visual animation effect using the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) language. They allow you to animate the properties of an element, such as its size, color, or position, over a specified period.” This coding language is compatible with its cousin HTML when it comes to incurring a website to be more engaging, interactive and communicate it’s message to the user.</p>  
                        
                        <p>Although, it should be noted that certain Developers would prefer the JavaScript Language but the neat thing about CSS is that there is no need to include additional coding to create a dynamic content. According to Hubspot, the way to implement a CSS animation into a basic bland website is “you need three things: an HTML element to animate, a CSS rule which binds the animation to this element, and a group of keyframes that defines the styles at the start and end of the animation. You can also add declarations to further customize your animation, like speed and delay.” </p>
                        
                        Now within the scope of CSS Animations, there are certain properties that we need to be aware of. Firstly being “@keyframes” which is used to specifically define a animation. The rest of the properties come as a sub-sector to the “animation” property such as is in the list, taken from “dofactory”: 

                        <ul>
                        
                            <li>animation-name</li> 
                            <li>animation-duration, <li>required to play <li>animation </li>
                            <li>animation-timing-function </li>
                            <li>animation-delay </li>
                            <li>animation-iteration-count</li> 
                            <li>animation-direction </li>
                            <li>animation-fill-mode </li>
                            <li>animation-play-state </li>
                        
                        </ul>
                        
                            <p>Furthermore, as fancy as the executions of these CSS animations may be, a crucial point is to be noted that Different Browsers support these animations at their own pace. 
                        </p>


                        <H3>Something to reflect about</H3>

            <p>A message that I want you to think about: Think about why you are here and your purpose. Do not beleive
                that you are made for nothing but rather find your motive and be the best at it</p>
