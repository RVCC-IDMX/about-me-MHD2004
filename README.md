## About Me
This assigment throughout the college semester has been used to teach us the basics of HTML,CSS while intoducing us to concepts of _Markdown_,_Photo sizing_, _Content PLacement_ and _Color Implementations._ We have been taught to cleverly design our websites to meet the basic needs of the clients or organziations while inculcating the creative touches of multiple individuals.

One of the realizations we acquired from these assignments is the necessity of Time Managment. Not only that, but even the management of tiny details that have an impact on the User's expereince such hamburger icon( Props to the person that named this). Web Development required learning of internet security protocols such as HTTPS. 

In addition, There was also the good __File Management Hygiene__. Some of these good hygeines included saving the file in the appropriate folder and format, naming the file correctly and determining the parent/root directory.

## Color Scheme
For this Project, we were assigned to choose colors that were not only __visually appealling__, but also take into consideration the group of people that have certain limitations or disabilities when it comes to __processing colors__. I chose a rather mild color. Going for variations of Red and Yellowish Brown.

The Hex and RGB Codes for Each Color are listed below:

* #c4534b
OR rgb(196, 83, 75)
* #c4534b
OR rgb(196, 83, 75)
* #e4fab8
OR rgb(228, 250, 184)
* #040505
OR rgb(4, 5, 5)
* #daba51
OR rgb(218, 186, 81)
* #f47074
OR rgb(244, 112, 116)

Make a website appealing is one of the challengers multiple Web Designers have to face. The right choice of fonts, styles, box elements and Of Course, Animations. Animations on a website, like the smooth hover off the cursor, or the swift transition of the button and even the loading screen of that slow loading website. 

One of the ways to apply Animation on certain sections of a website is through the use of CSS Animation. According to SimpliLearn, CSS Animations are “a way to create a visual animation effect using the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) language. They allow you to animate the properties of an element, such as its size, color, or position, over a specified period.” This coding language is compatible with its cousin HTML when it comes to incurring a website to be more engaging, interactive and communicate it’s message to the user.  

Although, it should be noted that certain Developers would prefer the JavaScript Language but the neat thing about CSS is that there is no need to include additional coding to create a dynamic content. According to Hubspot, the way to implement a CSS animation into a basic bland website is “you need three things: an HTML element to animate, a CSS rule which binds the animation to this element, and a group of keyframes that defines the styles at the start and end of the animation. You can also add declarations to further customize your animation, like speed and delay.” 

Now within the scope of CSS Animations, there are certain properties that we need to be aware of. Firstly being “@keyframes” which is used to specifically define a animation. The rest of the properties come as a sub-sector to the “animation” property such as is in the list, taken from “dofactory”: 

    animation-name 
    animation-duration, required to play animation 
    animation-timing-function 
    animation-delay 
    animation-iteration-count 
    animation-direction 
    animation-fill-mode 
    animation-play-state 

Furthermore, as fancy as the executions of these CSS animations may be, a crucial point is to be noted that Different Browsers support these animations at their own pace.
