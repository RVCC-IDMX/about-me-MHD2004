## About Me
This assigment throughout the college semester has been used to teach us the basics of HTML,CSS while intoducing us to concepts of _Markdown_,_Photo sizing_, _Content PLacement_ and _Color Implementations._ We have been taught to cleverly design our websites to meet the basic needs of the clients or organziations while inculcating the creative touches of multiple individuals.

One of the realizations we acquired from these assignments is the necessity of Time Managment. Not only that, but even the management of tiny details that have an impact on the User's expereince such hamburger icon( Props to the person that named this). Web Development required learning of internet security protocols such as HTTPS. 

In addition, There was also the good __File Management Hygiene__. Some of these good hygeines included saving the file in the appropriate folder and format, naming the file correctly and determining the parent/root directory.

## Color Scheme
For this Project, we were assigned to choose colors that were not only __visually appealling__, but also take into consideration the group of people that have certain limitations or disabilities when it comes to __processing colors__. I chose a rather mild color. Going for variations of Red and Yellowish Brown.

The Hex and RGB Codes for Each Color are listed below:

* #c4534b
OR rgb(196, 83, 75)
* #c4534b
OR rgb(196, 83, 75)

OR rgb(228, 250, 184)
